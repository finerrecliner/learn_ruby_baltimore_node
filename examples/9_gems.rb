In Ruby, libriaries are called "gems", and we need to install them onto our machine before we can use them.

In order to install these gems we need an application to install them for us, called rubygems: http://docs.rubygems.org/read/chapter/1

After installing rubygems, you can now install gems from the commandline using the "gem" command, below is an example:
  -> gem install fastercsv
